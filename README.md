## 🌟 Project Overview

"The Movie Library" is a comprehensive information system developed for a network of movie theaters to enhance business processes and improve customer experience. The system provides features like browsing movie listings, purchasing tickets, accessing home viewing options, managing multi-entry tickets, and optimizing customer service.

This project was developed as a semester-long assignment for the Software Engineering course, during the Spring 2024 semester.

## 🛠️ Key Features

1. **🎬 Movie Listings**: Allows users to browse a list of current and upcoming movies, with detailed information such as titles (in Hebrew and English), main actors, directors, producers, and synopses. Additionally, users can view movie posters and trailers.

2. **🎟️ Ticket Purchase**: Facilitates the purchase of tickets for movie screenings at theaters. Users can select seats through an interactive map and complete payments securely. After the purchase, users receive an email confirmation with the details of the transaction.

3. **🏠 Home Viewing Links**: Enables the purchase of links for home viewing of selected movies, available for a limited time. Users receive email reminders one hour before the link activation.

4. **🎫 Multi-Entry Tickets**: Offers discounted multi-entry tickets that provide access to multiple screenings at any theater in the network, subject to seat availability.

5. **📞 Customer Service**: Provides a robust framework for handling customer complaints and managing refunds efficiently. Customer service representatives can process refunds, offer compensations, and ensure timely responses to complaints.

6. **📊 Operational Monitoring**: Generates monthly reports for operational monitoring, including ticket sales, complaint handling, and overall performance metrics.

## 🧩 System Components

- **Theater Network Management**: Manages multiple theaters across different locations, each with unique configurations, including halls, seating arrangements, and operational schedules.

- **Movie and Screening Management**: Keeps an updated list of movies and their scheduled screenings, with the ability to manage future releases and promotions.

- **Ticketing and Sales Management**: Handles all aspects of ticket sales, both for in-theater screenings and home viewing, with options for refunds and exchanges based on specific rules.

- **Customer and Employee Management**: Supports user authentication and authorization, allowing different access levels for customers, employees, and managers.

- **Data Analysis and Reporting**: Produces detailed reports that help in analyzing sales trends, customer behavior, and operational efficiency, aiding in strategic decision-making.

## 🔄 System Architecture

- **Distributed Client-Server Model**: The system is built on a client-server architecture, supporting multiple users simultaneously from different endpoints.
- **Relational Database**: Utilizes a relational database to store and manage data related to movies, screenings, users, and transactions.
- **Java-Based Development**: The project is developed in Java, providing a stable and scalable platform that can be extended for internet-based access in future versions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OmerChernia/HaSertia.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd HaSertia
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies and Run**:
   Follow the detailed installation instructions in the setup guide provided in the repository.

## 📂 Additional Documentation
Included in this repository are UML diagrams (.vpp files) that illustrate the system architecture and design.
These diagrams provide a visual representation of the system components, their interactions, and data flow.

## 🧪 Testing and Validation
The project includes a comprehensive testing framework to ensure all features work as expected. Tests cover:

- **Functional Testing**: Validates core functionalities such as ticket purchasing, seat selection, and payment processing.
- **Error Handling**: Ensures proper error messages and redirections for invalid inputs or failed transactions.
- **User Interface Testing**: Checks the responsiveness and usability of the GUI.

## 📦 Prototyping with JSON
We experimented with an initial prototype of the project using JSON to model data interactions and simulate user flows. This approach helped us identify key requirements and refine the system design before full implementation. You can view the prototype and JSON files in the repository [here](https://github.com/OmerChernia/HaSertia.git).
